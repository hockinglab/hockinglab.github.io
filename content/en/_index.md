## Presentation of the lab in 5 minutes

[Google slides, updated Nov 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QQNNjdupQZm34XIsO_nnF-ilnH5R-tRBvG82oL1tOB0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Research areas

The LASSO group is an academic research laboratory specializing in

* Learning Algorithms: fundamental new algorithms that can be applied to a wide range of different kinds of data (images, text, audio, time series, biological sequences, etc).
* Statistical Software: new free/open-source software packages for large data analysis.
* Optimization: algorithms based on ideas from convex optimization (gradient descent) and discrete optimization (dynamic programming).

Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which is
concerned with algorithms for large data. Our lab works in this area,
with particular expertise in algorithms for accurate and interpretable
analysis of scientific data, from fields such as genomics,
neuroscience, medicine, microbiome, cybersecurity, robotics,
satellite/sonar imagery, climate/carbon modeling.

The acronym "LASSO" is a reference to the highly influential paper by
Tibshirani, "Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso," JRSSB
(1996), which is an inspiration for our research into interpretable
machine learning.
